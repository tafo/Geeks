# Geeks
Solutions of practices in GeeksForGeeks.

The solutions to basic problems at least can benefit students. 
  (And they were also used to practice Git, GitHub, Terminal, etc.) 

A class name might start with a verb even if it doesn't satisfy the default naming convention. 

Because of (???) reason, a variable name might be a single character even if it isn't a good practice.  

I am open to any kind of feedback. Bug report, suggestion, ...
