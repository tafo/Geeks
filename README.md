# Geeks
Solutions of practices in GeeksForGeeks.

The solutions to basic problems at least can benefit students. 
  (And they were also used to practice Git, GitHub, Terminal, etc.) 

A class name might start with a verb even if it doesn't satisfy the default naming convention. 

Because of (???) reason, a variable name might be a single character even if it isn't a good practice.  

I am open to any kind of feedback. Bug report, suggestion, ...

## REMARKS
* If C# is not an available programming language, then its C++ or JAVA solution is included in the summary section
* I used LINQ in the "SortBySpecificOrder" and subsequent practices
* The execution time has a margin of error of &#0177;30 miliseconds
  * The example inputs that are commented out in the summary section are **not** actual test data. They are just *simple* input examples.  
* I stopped using StringScanner if it is not crucial in the "Pendulum" and subsequent practices
